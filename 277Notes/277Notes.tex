    \section{Vector Functions in Two and Three Space}
    \subsection{Vector Function: }
    A vector function $\vec{r}$ is a rule that assigns to each real
    number $t$, one and only one vector 
    $$\begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\  y(t)\\ z(t)\end{pmatrix}$$ or using the
    unit vectors
    $\hat{i}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{smallmatrix}\right)$,
    $\hat{j}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{smallmatrix}\right)$
    and
    $\hat{k}=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{smallmatrix}\right)$,
    
    $$x(t)\hat{i}+y(t)\hat{j}+z(t)\hat{k}$$ and is written 
    \[
        \begin{split}
            \vec{r}(t) &= \begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\\z(t)\end{pmatrix}\\ 
            \text{or\ } &= x(t)\hat{i}+y(t)\hat{j}+z(t)\hat{k}
        \end{split}
    \]
    \subsubsection{Geometric Interpretation of a Vector Function:}
    Given a vector function $$\vec{r}(t) =
    \begin{pmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\\z(t)\end{pmatrix}$$ assuming that the
    functions $x(t)$, $y(t)$, and $z(t)$ are continuous for some
    interval $I$. The vector function $\vec{r}(t)$, $t\in I$ may be
    thought of as the position of a moving particle at time $t$ in
    three-space. As time $t$ varies, the terminal point of the position
    vector traces a space curve $C$.\\ 
    The space curve $C$ is said to be given parametrically by the vector
    function
    $\vec{r}(t)=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}x(t)\\y(t)\\z(t)\end{smallmatrix}\right)$
    or is given by the three equations
    $$ \left\{
    \begin{array}{lr}
        x(t)\\
        y(t)\\
        z(t)
    \end{array}
    \right.\ t\in I$$
    \subsubsection{Endpoints and Orientation of a space or Plane Curve:}
    Let $C$ be the space curve given parametrically by the vector
    function $\vec{r}(t)$, where $t$ is in the closed interval $[a,b]$.
    The initial and terminal points of the curve $C$ are defined
    respectively by $\vec{r}(a)$, and $\vec{r}(b)$. Note that if the
    endpoints coincide the curve $C$ is closed. The orientation of curve
    $C$ is the direction from the initial point $P$ toward the terminal
    point $Q$ and is usually denoted with one or two arrow heads.\\\\

    \subsubsection{Derivative Rules for Vector Functions:}
    let $\vec u(t)$ and $\vec v (t)$ be vector functions with
    differentiable components and $f(t)$ be a scalar function.\\
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The sum and difference rule: $\frac{d}{dt}\bigg\{\vec
        u(t)\pm \vec v(t)\bigg\}=\vec u\ '(t)\pm\vec v\ '(t)$
        \item The scalar Multiple Rule: $\frac{d}{dt}\bigg\{f(t)\vec
        u(t)\bigg\}=f'(t)\vec u(t)+f(t)\vec u\ '(t)$
        \item The dot Product Rule: $\frac{d}{dt}\bigg\{\vec u(t)\cdot
        \vec v(t)\bigg\}=\vec u\ '(t)\cdot \vec v(t)+\vec u(t)\cdot \vec
        v\ '(t)$
        \item The Cross Product Rule: $\frac{d}{dt}\bigg\{\vec
        u(t)\times \vec v(t)\bigg\}=\vec u\ '(t)\times \vec v(t)+\vec
        u(t)\times \vec v\ '(t)$
        \item The Chain Rule: $\frac{d}{dt}\bigg\{\vec
        u(f(t))\bigg\}=\vec u\ '(f(t))f'(t)$
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Motion of a particle in Two and Three-Space}
    \textbf{Position: $\vec r(t)$}\\
    By definition the position of a moving particle at time $t$ is $\vec
    r(t)$.\\\\
    \textbf{Velocity: $\vec v(t)$}\\
    By definition the average velocity is given by $\vec
    v_{ave}=\frac{\Delta\vec r(t)}{\Delta t}$. Let $P$ and $Q$ be the
    position of a particle at time $t$ and $t+\Delta t$ where $\Delta t$
    is small. The the velocity of a particle between $P$ and $Q$ is
    defined, 
    $$\vec v_{P\rightarrow Q}=\frac{Q-P}{t+\Delta t-t}=\frac{\vec
    r(t+\Delta t)-\vec r(t)}{\Delta t}$$ If the limit is taken as
    $\Delta t\rightarrow 0$ then,
    $$\vec v(t)=\lim\limits_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\vec r(t+\Delta
    t)-\vec r(t)}{\Delta t}=\frac{d\vec r}{dt}=\vec r\ '(t)$$ It follows
    that the tangent line to the curve $C$ at $P$ is in the direction of
    the velocity vector at $P$.
    $$\vec v(t)=\frac{d\vec r}{dt}= \frac{dx}{dt}\hat i+
    \frac{dy}{dt}\hat j +\frac{dz}{dt}\hat k$$ \textbf{Acceleration:
    $\vec a(t)$}\\
    By definition the acceleration is the derivative of velocity with
    respect to time,
    $$\vec a (t)=\frac{d\vec v}{dt}=\frac{d^2\vec r}{dt^2}$$
    \textbf{Speed: $v(t)$}\\
    By definition the speed is the magnitude or norm of the velocity,
    $$v(t)=||\vec v (t)||$$ \textbf{Distance Traveled: $L$}\\
    The distance traveled or arc length of a curve on the interval
    $[a,b]$ is denoted and defined
    $$L=\int\limits_a^bv\,
    dt=\int\limits_a^b\sqrt{\frac{dx}{dt}^2+\frac{dy}{dt}^2+\frac{dz}{dt}^2}\,
    dt$$
    \subsection{Special Parametric Curves:}
    \textbf{The Straight Line Segment}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        Recall the parametric Vector equation of a Straight Line 
        $$\vec r (t)=\vec{r_0}=t\vec v,\ t\in\mathbb{R}$$ Here
        $\vec{r_0}$ is equivilant to the point $P=(x_1,y_1)$ and $\vec
        v=\begin{pmatrix} x_2-x_1\\y_2-y_1\end{pmatrix}$.
        $$\therefore \vec r(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\
        y_1\end{pmatrix}+t\begin{pmatrix}x_2-x_1\\y_2-y_1\end{pmatrix},\
        t\in\mathbb{R}$$ If follows that the parametric vector equation
        of the straight line segment with initial point $P=(x_1,y_1)$
        and terminal point $Q=(x_2, y_2)$ is given by
        $$\vec r(t)=\begin{pmatrix}x_1\\

        $$\vec r(t)=(h+a\cos(t))\hat i+(k+b\sin(t))\hat j,\
        t\in[0,2\pi]$$ or parametrically as 
        $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}+\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1$$
        \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:5] \draw[thick, ->](-1,0)-- (5,0)

            [decorate, decoration={brace, amplitude=7pt,mirror}] (2,
            2.9)--(3,2.9) node[midway, yshift=-10pt]{$a$};
            \end{tikzpicture}\\
    \end{multicols}
    \textbf{The Circle}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        The parametric vector equation of a circle centered at $(h,k)$
        with radius $a$ is given by
        $$\vec r(t)=(h+a\cos(t))\hat i+(k+b\sin(t))\hat j$$ or
        parametrically as
        $$(x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=a^2$$
        \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:5] \draw[thick, ->](-1,0)-- (5,0)
            node[above]{$x$}; \draw[thick, ->](0,-1)-- (0,5)
            node[right]{$y$}; \draw[blue] (3,3) circle(1.5); \draw[thin,

            red](3,1)--(3,5); \end{tikzpicture}\\
    \end{multicols}
    \textbf{The Hyperbola}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        The parametric vector equation of the right hand branch of a
        hyperbola with center at $(h,k)$, semi transverse axis of length
        $a$ and semi conjugate axis of length $b$ is given by
        $$\vec r(t)=(h+a\cosh(t))\hat i+(k+b\sinh(t))\hat j,
        t\in\mathbb{R}$$ or parametrically as
        $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2}-\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2}=1$$
        \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=0:5] \draw[thick, ->](-1,0)-- (5,0)
            node[above]{$x$}; \draw[thick, ->](0,-1)-- (0,5)
            node[right]{$y$}; \draw[blue, domain=-1.3:1.3]
            plot({3+cosh(\x)}, {3+sinh(\x)}); \draw[blue,
            domain=-1.3:1.3] plot({3-cosh(\x)}, {3+sinh(\x)});
            \draw[thin, red](1,3)--(5,3) node[pos=0.62, below]{$(h,k)$};
            \draw[thin, red](3,1)--(3,5); \end{tikzpicture}\\
    \end{multicols}
    \textbf{The Parabola}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        There is no standard parametric vector equation for a parabola.
        There instead are infinitely many parametric vector equations
        for a parabola. To find a parametric vector equation for a
        parabola simply assign any value for $x$, or $y$ asa long as the
        values of $x$ and $y$ are not restricted. The cartesian
        equations of a parabola are
        \begin{align*}
            &y=ax^2+bx+c,& a\neq 0\\
            \mathrm{or}\ & x=ay^2+by+c,& a\neq 0
        \end{align*}
        \begin{tikzpicture}[domain=-1:3] \draw[thick, ->](-1,0)-- (5,0)
            node[above]{$x$}; \draw[thick, ->](0,-1)-- (0,5)
            node[right]{$y$}; \draw[blue] plot(\x, {(\x)^2-(\x)-1});
            \end{tikzpicture}\\
    \end{multicols}
    \subsection{Special Parametric Curves in Space:}
    \textbf{The Straight Line Segment:}\\
    The parametric Vector equation of the straight line segment given by
    the points $P(x_1, y_1, z_1)$ and $Q(x_2, y_2, z_2)$ is given by 
    $$\vec r= \vec{r_0}+t\vec v,\ t\in[0,1]$$\ Where $\vec{r_0}=P$ and
    $\vec v=\vec{PQ}$ or parametrically as
    $$\vec r(t)=\left\{\begin{array}{lr} x=x_1+(x_2-x_1)t\\
        y=y_1+(y_2-y_1)t\\
        z=z_1+(z_2-z_1)t \end{array}\right.$$ \textbf{The Helix:}\\
    A Helix is a wire wrapped around the surface of a cylinder. If the
    cylinder is a right circular cylinder with radius $a$ and height
    $b$, then the parametric vector equation of the helix is given by
    $$\vec r(t)=\begin{pmatrix} a\cos(t)\\
        a\sin(t)\\
        bt \end{pmatrix},\ t\in[0,2\pi]$$
    \subsection{General Curves in Space:}
    A space curve C is the intersection of 2 surfaces, say $S_1$ and
    $S_2$. For instance
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The intersection of 2 planes is a straight line
        \item The intersection of a cone and a plane generates a conic
        section (circle, an ellipse, a parabola, a hyperbola, or a pair
        of lines.)
    \end{enumerate}
    Let $C$ be the curve of intersection of $S_1$ and $S_2$ where
    \begin{equation}\label{S1}
        S_1:f(x,y,z)=0
    \end{equation}
    \begin{equation}\label{S2}
        S_2:g(x,y,z)=0
    \end{equation}
    To find the parametric vector equation of the space curve $C$,
    attempt to use equations \eqref{S1} and \eqref{S2} to obtain a third
    equation consisting of only two of the three variables. When this
    equation is viewed in $\mathbb{R}^2$ (the xy-plane, xz-plane or
    yz-plane), it can easily be parametrized.
    \subsection{The $\vec T$, $\vec N$, and $\vec B$ Frame}
    First Recall the definition of a unit vector. If If $\vec v$ is a
    vector in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then $\vec v$ is a unit vector if and only
    if the length of $v$ is 1. Let $C$ be a plane or space curve given
    by the vector function $\vec r(t),\ t\in I$ and let $P$ be a point
    on curve $C$.
    \subsubsection{The Unit Tangent Vector: $\vec T(t)$}
    The unit tangent vector to curve $C$ at $P$ is denoted and defined
    by
    $$\vec T(t)=\frac{\vec v(t)}{||\vec v (t)||}$$ $\vec T(t)$ is a unit
    vector in the direction of the velocity and hence is tangent to the
    curve $C$ at $P$ and points in the orientation of $C$.
    \subsubsection{The Principle Unit Normal: $\vec N(t)$}
    The principle unit vector to the curve $C$ at $P$ is denoted and
    defined by
    $$\vec N(t)=\frac{\vec T(t)}{||\vec T(t)||}$$
    \subsubsection{The Curvature: $\kappa$}
    Given $\vec r(t)$ the rate of turn is given by
    $$\kappa=\left|\left|\frac{d\vec T}{ds}\right|\right|$$ where $s$
    denotes the arc length. This is the scalar quantity representing the
    change in $\vec T$ with respect to distance  travelled. This is
    called the curvature $\kappa$. The curvature $\kappa$ can also be
    defined as
    $$\kappa=\frac{\vec{v}\times\vec{a}}{v^3}$$
    \subsubsection{The Radius of Curvature $\rho$}
    At a point $P$ on a curve $C$ we define the radius of curvature by
    $$\rho=\frac{1}{\kappa}$$ The circle of radius $\rho$ tangent to
    curve $C$ at $P$ on the concave side is called the circle of
    curvature.
    \subsubsection{The Unit Binormal Vector: $\vec B$}
    The cross product of $\vec T$ and $\vec N$ is a vector orthogonal to
    both $\vec T$ and $\vec N$. This vector is denoted $\vec B(t)$ and
    is defined
    $$\vec B(t)=\vec T(t)\times \vec N(t)$$ The vector $\vec B$ is
    called the Unit Binormal Vector. Geometrically the $\vec T$, $\vec
    N$, and $\vec B$ vector determine the spacial properties of
    direction of travel, turn, and twist respectively of the curve $C$.
    \subsubsection{The Torsion: $\tau$}
    The torsion $\tau$ of a space curve $C$ is denoted and defined by 
    $$\tau=-\frac{d\vec B}{ds}\cdot\vec N$$ Geometrically the torsion
    provides a measure of the degree of twisting of a space curve. Given
    a curve $C=\vec r(t)$ the torsion can also be defined
    $$\tau=\frac{(\vec v\times \vec a)\cdot\vec a\,'}{||\vec v\times\vec
    a||^2}$$
    \subsection{Tangential and Normal Components of Acceleration}
    Let $a_T=\frac{dv}{dt}$ and $a_N=\kappa v^2$
    \begin{align*}
        \therefore \vec a(t)&=a_T \vec T+ a_N \vec N\\
        &=\frac{dv}{dt}\vec T+\kappa v^2\vec N
    \end{align*}
    The scalars $a_T$ and $a_N$ are respectively called the tangent
    component and normal component of acceleration.
    \subsubsection{Alternative formula for the Tangent and Normal components of Acceleration}
    The normal component of acceleration can be given by
    $$a_N=\frac{||\vec v\times \vec a||}{v}$$ The tangential component
    of acceleration can be given by
    $$a_T=\vec T\cdot\vec a =\frac{\vec v\cdot \vec a}{v}$$
    \subsection{Summary and alternative Formula of $\vec T$, $\vec N$, $\vec B$, $\kappa$, $\rho$, $\tau$, $a_T$, and $a_N$}
    \begin{align}
        \vec T=\frac{\vec v}{v}\\
        \vec B=\frac{\vec v\times\vec a}{||\vec v\times \vec a||}\\
        \vec N=\vec B\times \vec T\\
        \kappa=\frac{||\vec v\times \vec a||}{v^3}\\
        \rho=\frac{1}{\kappa}\\
        \tau=\frac{(\vec v\times \vec a)\cdot\vec a\, '}{||\vec v\times \vec a||^2}\\
        a_N=\frac{||\vec v\times \vec a||}{v}\\
        a_T=\vec T\cdot\vec a =\frac{\vec v\cdot \vec a}{v}\\
        \vec T=\vec N\times\vec B\\
        \vec B=\vec B\times N
    \end{align}
    \subsection{Applications of Vector Functions}
    \subsubsection{The Rocket Equation}
    A rocket moves forward by the backward expulsion of a mass of gas
    formed by burning its onboard fuel.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $M$: The total initial mass of the rocket including its
        fuel.
        \item $m=m(t)$: total mass of the rocket at time $t$. Hence
        $m+\Delta m$ is the total mass of the rocket at time $t+\Delta
        t$. It follows that $\Delta m<0$ and $-\Delta m>0$. Therefore
        the amount of fuel burnet over a time interval $\Delta t$ is
        $-\Delta m$.
        \item $\vec v=\vec v(t)$: The velocity of the rocket at time $t$
        relative to the earth. Hence $\vec v+\Delta\vec v$ is the
        velocity at time $t+\Delta t$
        \item $-\vec{v_e}$: The velocity of the ejected gas (assume
        constant). It follows that $\vec v+\vec{v_e}$ is the velocity of
        the ejected gas relative to the earth.
        \item $\alpha$: The rate at which the fuel mixture is burned in
        the rocket (assume constant).
        $$\therefore-\alpha=\frac{dm}{dt}\Rightarrow m=\int\alpha\,
        dt=-\alpha t+M$$ or
        \begin{equation}\label{mass}
            m(t)=M-\alpha t
        \end{equation}
        \item $\vec F$: The net force acting on the rocket
        \item $\vec p(t)$ The momentum of the rocket. $\vec p(t)=m\vec
        v$. Hence the change in momentum over time is thus given by
    \end{enumerate}
    \begin{align*}
        \Delta\vec p&=\vec p(t+\Delta t)-\vec p(t)\\
        &=\big[(m+\Delta m)(\vec v+\Delta\vec v)+(-\Delta m)(\vec v+\vec {v_e})\big]-m\vec v\\
        &=\big[m\vec v+m\Delta\vec v+\vec v\Delta m+\Delta m\Delta\vec v-\vec v\Delta m-\vec{v_e}\Delta m\big]-m\vec v\ \text{\footnotemark}\\
        &=m\Delta\vec v-\Delta m\, \vec v_e\\
        \frac{\Delta\vec p}{\Delta t}&=m \frac{\Delta\vec v}{\Delta t}-\vec{v_e}\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}\\
        \lim\limits_{\Delta\rightarrow0}\frac{\Delta\vec p}{\Delta t}&=m \lim\limits_{\Delta\rightarrow0}\frac{\Delta\vec v}{\Delta t}-\vec{v_e}\lim\limits_{\Delta\rightarrow0}\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}\\
    \end{align*}
    \footnotetext{Note $\Delta m\Delta v$ is very small and is therefore omitted}
    \begin{equation}\label{momentum}
        \frac{d\vec p}{d t}=m \frac{d\vec v}{d t}-\vec{v_e}\frac{d m}{d t}
    \end{equation}
    Apply Newtons second law of motion, the derivative of momentum with
    respect to time is $\vec F=\frac{d\vec p}{dt}$, to \eqref{momentum}
    to obtain
    \begin{equation}\label{Force1}
        \vec F=m \frac{d\vec v}{d t}-\vec{v_e}\frac{d m}{d t}\\
    \end{equation}
    Assumptions
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Assume the rocket moves in a straight line vertically
        upward. Hence $\vec F=0\rightarrow F=0\hat k$, $\vec v=v\hat k$,
        $v$ being the speed of the rocket relative to the earth, and
        $\vec{v_e}=-v_e\hat k$, $v_e$ being the speed of the ejected gas
        relative to the rocket.
        \item The rocket is initially at rest. Hence $M=m(t)$ when $v=$.
    \end{enumerate}
    Substitute for $v$, $v_e$, and $F$ from the above assumptions into
    \eqref{Force1}
    \begin{align*}
        0&=m\frac{dv}{dt}-v_e\frac{dm}{dt}\\
        m\, \frac{dv}{dt}&=-v_e\frac{dm}{dt}   
    \end{align*}
    \begin{equation}\label{dv}
        \frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{v_e} {m}\frac{dm}{dt}
    \end{equation}
    Integrate both sides of \eqref{dv}
    \begin{align*}
        \int\limits_0^t \frac{dv}{dt}\, dt&=\int\limits_0^t -\frac{v_e} {m}\frac{dm}{dt}\, dt\\
        v(t)-v(0)&=-v_e\ln(m(t))+v_e\ln(m(0))
    \end{align*}
    Therefore the velocity of a rocket at time $t$ is given by
    \begin{equation}\label{rocket}
        v(t)=v_e\ln\left(\frac{M}{m(t)}\right)
    \end{equation}
    Subbing in \eqref{mass} into \eqref{rocket} then gives
    $$v(t)=v_e\ln\left(\frac{M}{M-\alpha t}\right)$$
    
    \subsubsection{Banking of a Road Turn:}
    If a road is straight, its design is horizontal. However, when on a
    sharp turn it becomes angled. This design is referred to as banking
    of a road turn. Banked road turns have a rated speed limit that must
    be followed in order to use the road safely. Here we shall only look
    at frictionless roads. If a curve is banking at an angle $\theta$,
    with a radius of curvature $\rho$ and a rated speed of $v$, then the
    quantities are related by
    $$\tan \theta=\frac{v^2}{g\rho}$$

    \subsection{Quadric Surfaces:}
    A quadratic equation in $x$, $y$, and $z$ is called a quadric
    surface. Quadric surfaces may be thought of as three dimensional
    versions of conic sections. Let $a$, $b$, and $c$ be positive
    \subsubsection{The Ellipsoid Family:}
    \textbf{The Ellipsoid:}

        \begin{equation}
            \frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1
        \end{equation}
        The ellipsoid is centered at $(0, 0, 0)$ and has semi axis $a$,
        $b$, and $c$.\\

    \subsubsection{The Paraboloid Family:}
    \textbf{The Elliptic Paraboloid:}

    \textbf{The Circular Paraboloid:}

    \textbf{The Hyperbolic Paraboloid:}

        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Hyperbolic_Paraboloid.png}
    \end{multicols}
    Each Paraboloid has vertex at the origin $(0,0,0)$ and axis of symmetry about the z-axis.

    \subsubsection{The Hyperboloid Family:}
    \textbf{The Hyperboloid of One Sheet:}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        \begin{equation}\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1\end{equation}

    \textbf{The Hyperboloid of Two Sheets:}
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        \begin{equation}\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}-\frac{z^2}{c^2}=-1\end{equation}

    \textbf{The Cone:}
    
    \begin{multicols}{2}
        \begin{equation}z^2=\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}\end{equation}
        \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Cone.png}
    \end{multicols}
    Hyperboloids of one and two sheets have centers about the origin
    $(0,0,0)$ and a axis of symmetry about the z-axis. If the cone has
    $a=b$ then it is a circular cone. If we solve the equation of the
    cone for $z$.
    $$z=\pm\sqrt{\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}}$$ With the positive
    being the upper half and the negative being the lower half.\\\\
    If in all eight equations we replace $x$, $y$, and $z$ respectively
    by $x-h$, $y-k$ and $z-l$, we obtain a translated quadric surface
    with center or vertex at $(h,k,l)$. The equation of a quadric
    surface with axis of symmetry being or parallel to the x or y-axis
    is similar to the z axis.
    \subsection{Special Surfaces:}
    \subsubsection{The Plane:}
    $$Ax+By+Cz=D$$ where $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$ are real and not all 0.
    There are 6 special planes.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $z=0$ The equation of the $xy$ plane.
        \item $z=l$ A plane parallel to the $xy$ plane $l$ units apart.
        \item $y=0$ The equation of the $xz$ plane.
        \item $y=k$ A plane parallel to the $xz$ plane $k$ units apart.
        \item $x=0$ The equation of the $yz$ plane.
        \item $x=h$ A plane parallel to the $yz$ plane $h$ units apart.
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsubsection{Special Cylinders}
    An equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$ containing only 2 variables is an
    equation of a cylinder with generators parallel to the missing
    variable axis. The function $F(x,y)=0$ is a cylinder parallel to the
    $z$-axis where $F(x,y)=0$ is the boundary of the base of the
    cylinder.
    \subsection{Functions of two and three independent Variables:}
    \subsubsection{A Function of Two Independent Variables:}
    A function $f$ of two independent variables is a rule that assigns
    to each permissible ordered pair from a set $D$ in the $xy$-plane,
    one and only one real number $z$ and is denoted
    $$z=f(x,y)$$ A function of three or more independent variables is
    defined similarly.\\\\
    \subsubsection{Domain of a Function of Two Independent Variables:}
    The domain of $z=f(x,y)$ is the set (collection) of all ordered
    pairs $(x,y)$ such that $f$ is defined and real. The domain of $f$
    may be denoted $D$ or $dmf$. The domain for functions of three or
    more variables is defined similarly.
    \subsubsection{Graph of a Function of Two Independent Variables:}
    First recall the graph of a function of a single variable $y=f(x)$
    is: The set of ordered pairs of $(x,f(x))$. The graph of a function
    of a single variable is referred to as a curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$.
    Likewise the graph of a function of two independent variables
    $z=f(x,y)$ is the set of all ordered triples,
    $$(x,y,z)=(x,y,z(f(x,y)))$$ The graph of $z=f(x,y)$ is referred to
    as a surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. Likewise for a function of $n$
    variables its graph generates a hypersurface in
    $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$\\\\
    \subsubsection{Level Curves and Surfaces of a function of 2 or 3 variables:}
    Let $S$ be the surface given by $z=f(x,y)$. If $z$ is fixed to a
    constant $z=c$, then the curve $c=f(x,y)$, is a cross section or
    level curve of $f$ at $z=c$. Likewise if we have a hypersurface
    $w=f(x,y,z)$, $w$ can be fixed as a constant $w=c$ and then
    $c=f(x,y,z)$ is a level surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$. A collection of
    level curves is known as a contour map.
    \subsection{Partial Derivatives for functions of Several Variables}
    \subsubsection{Partial Derivatives of a function of Two Independent Variables}
    Let $z=f(x,y)$. The partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $x$ is
    denoted and defined by
    $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}=f_x=\lim\limits_{h\rightarrow
    0}\frac{f(x+h, y)-f(x,y)}{h}$$ provided the limit exists.\\
    The partial derivative of $z$ with respect to $y$ is denoted and
    defined by
    $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}=f_y=\lim\limits_{k\rightarrow
    0}\frac{f(x, y+k)-f(x,y)}{k}$$ provided the limit exists. It is
    evident from the definition that to compute $f_x$ treat $y$ as a
    constant and differentiate. The partial derivative $f_y$ is computed
    similarly by holding $x$ constant.
    \subsubsection{Other Notation for Partial Derivatives:}
    Let $z=f(x,y)$. The partial derivative of $f$ may be denoted by
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial
        f}{\partial y}$
        \item $f_x(x,y)$, $f_y(x,y)$
        \item $f_1(x,y)$, $f_2(x,y)$
    \end{enumerate} 
    \subsubsection{Partial Derivatives of functions of $n$ independent variables}
    Let $f(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ be a function of $n$ independent
    variables. The partial derivative of $f$ with respect to $x_i$ where
    $i\in \mathbb{N},\ i\leq n$ is given by
    $$\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=\lim\limits_{h\rightarrow
    0}\frac{f(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_i+h, \cdots, x_n)-f(x_1, x_2, \cdots,
    x_n)}{h}$$ provided the limit exists.
    \subsubsection{Higher Order Derivatives:}
    Let $z=f(x,y)$. $\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial
    z}{\partial y}$ are called the first order partial derivatives of
    $f$. The second order partial derivatives are given by
    $$\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial x^2}=f_{xx}=\frac{\partial}{\partial
    x}\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial x}\right)$$ 
    $$\frac{\partial^2z}{\partial y^2}=f_{yy}=\frac{\partial}{\partial
    y}\left(\frac{\partial z}{\partial y}\right)$$ Mixed Partials
    $$\frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial x\partial
    y}=f_{yx}=\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial
    z}{\partial y}\right)$$
    $$\frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial y\partial
    x}=f_{xy}=\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\left(\frac{\partial
    z}{\partial x}\right)$$ The mixed partials are not necessarily
    equal. Let $z=f(x,y)$. If $f_x$, $f_y$, $f_{xy}$, $f_{yx}$ are all
    continuous at some point $P$, then the mixed partials exist and are
    equal at $P$.
    $$\frac{\partial^2 z}{\partial x\partial y}=\frac{\partial^2
    z}{\partial y\partial x}$$ Second order derivatives are defined
    similarly for functions of more variables. In general for a function
    of $m$ variables there is $m^n$ $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ order derivatives.
    \subsubsection{The Chain Rule for functions of Several Variables:}
    Let us first recall the chain rule for a single variable function.
    Let $y=f(x)$ where $x$ is a function of $t$ or $x=x(t)$. Hence $y$
    is indirectly a function of $t$, That is $y=y(t)$. To find
    $\frac{dy}{dt}$ compute,
    $$\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{df}{dx}\frac{dx}{dt}$$ Likewise $z=f(x,y)$
    where $x$ and $y$ are functions of $t$, or $x=x(t)$, $y=y(t)$.
    Obviously $z$ is a function of $t$, $z=z(t)$. It can be shown that,
    $$\frac{dz}{dt}=\frac{\partial f}{\partial
    x}\frac{dx}{dt}+\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dt}$$ There
    are endless formula for the chain rule for functions of several
    variables. Another example is let $z=f(x,y)$ where $x=x(u,v)$ and
    $y=y(u,v)$. Now $z$ is a function fo $u$ and $v$ and has derivatives
    $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial u}=\frac{\partial z}{\partial
    x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial u}+\frac{\partial z}{\partial
    y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial u}$$
    $$\frac{\partial z}{\partial v}=\frac{\partial z}{\partial
    x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial v}+\frac{\partial z}{\partial
    y}\frac{\partial y}{\partial v}$$
    \subsection{Tangent Planes and Normal Line to Surface:}
    \subsubsection{Gradient of a Function of Several Variables}
    Let $f(x,y,z)$ be a function of three independent variables $x$,
    $y$, and $z$, and let $P$ be the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$. The
    gradient of $F$ at $P$ is denoted and defined by
    $$\vec\nabla F=\begin{pmatrix} \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial y}\\
        \frac{\partial F}{\partial z}
    \end{pmatrix}$$
    \subsubsection{Geometric Interpretation of Gradient}
    Let $S$ be the surface given by the equation $F(x,y,z)=0$ and let
    $P(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ be a point on the surface. It can be easily
    verified that any vector orthogonal to the surface at $P$ is $N=\vec
    \nabla F(P)$. The line through point $P$ orthogonal to the surface
    is called the normal line to the surface at $P$
    \subsubsection{The Point Normal Form of a Plane}
    The equation of  a plane passing through a point $P(x_0, y_0, z_0)$
    with a normal vector $\vec N$ has the equation
    $$\vec N\cdot \vec r=0$$ where the vector $\vec r$ is given by
    $$\vec r=\begin{pmatrix} x-x_0\\
        y-y_0\\
        z-z_0 \end{pmatrix}$$ This equation is the point normal form of
    a plane.
    \subsection{Increments and Decrements:}
    Let $F(x,y)$ be a function of two independent variables $x$, and
    $y$. Assume that $(x,y)$ has changed from the initial value $(x_0,
    y_0$ to $(x_1, y_1)$. 
    \subsubsection{Increment or Change in Independent Variables}
    The increment or change in independent variables $x$, $y$ are
    respectively denoted and defined by
    $$\Delta x=x_1-x_0\text{ and }\Delta y=y_1-y_0$$ The relative change
    in the dependent variable is
    $$\Delta=z_1-z_0=F(x_1, y_1)-F(x_0, y_0)$$
    \subsubsection{Differentials of Independent and Dependent Variables}
    The differentials of independent variables $x$ and $y$ are
    respectively denoted and defined by
    $$\partial x=\Delta x\Rightarrow\partial x=x_1-x_0$$
    $$\partial y=\Delta y\Rightarrow\partial y=y_1-y_0$$ The
    differential of the dependent variable is denoted and defined by
    \begin{align*}
        \partial z=\partial F &=\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\partial x+\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\partial y\\
        \text{or} &= \frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\Delta x+\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\Delta y
    \end{align*}
    provided $\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial
    F}{\partial y}$ are continuous.\\\\
    We may think of $\Delta x$ and $\Delta y$ as the error in $x$, and
    $y$ respectively. $\Delta z$ or $F(x_1, y_1)-F(x_0, y_0)$ is not
    easy to calculate. However $\partial z$ is much easier to calculate.
    If $(x_1,y_1)$ is close to $(x_0, y_0)$ then
    $$\Delta F(x_1, y_1)\approx \partial F(x_0, y_0)$$
    \subsubsection{Error Types}
    Assume a certain quantity has changed from $P_0$ to $P$. Then
    $\Delta P= P-P_0$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Error: $\Delta P=P-P_0$
        \item Absolute Error: $|\Delta P|$
        \item Relative Error: $\frac{\Delta P}{P_0}$
        \item Percentage Error: $\frac{\Delta P}{P_0}\times 100\% $ 
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{The Laplace Equation in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$}
    The laplace equation in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is given by
    $$\nabla^2u=\frac{\partial^2u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2
    u}{\partial y^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}=0$$ An equation
    $u$ satisfying the laplace equation is called a harmonic function.
    \subsection{Linearization of a function of several variables}
    Let  $z=f(x,y)$ and let $P(x_0, y_0)$ be a given point. The
    linearization of $f(x,y)$ at a point $P(x_0, y_0)$ is denoted and
    defined by
    $$L(x,y)=f(x_0,y_0)+f_x(x_0, y_0)(x-x_0)+f_y(x_0, y_0)(y-y_0)$$
    \subsection{Directional Derivatives of functions of several variables}
    Let $f(x,y,z)$ be a function of three independent variables $x$,
    $y$, and $z$, and let $\vec u=\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix}$
    be a unit vector in the direction from the point $P(x_0, y_0, z_0)$
    to an arbitrary point $Q(x,y,z)$. The vector $\vec u$ is defined
    $$\vec u=\frac{\vec{PQ}}{||\vec
    {PQ}||}=\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix}$$ Let $s=||\vec{PQ}||$.
    Therefore the components of $\vec u$ can be written
    \begin{align}
        as&=x-x_0\label{a}\\
        bs&=y-y_0\label{b}\\
        cs&=z-z_0\label{c}
    \end{align}
    Now let $w=f(x,y,z)$ where $x=x_0+as$, $y=y_0+bs$, $z=z_0+cs$. Hence
    $w$ is a function of $s$. By the chain rule
    $$\frac{dw}{ds}=f_x(x,y,z)a+f_y(x,y,z)b+f_z(x,y,z)c$$ and evaluate
    $\frac{dw}{ds}$ at $s=0$. Recall \eqref{a}, \eqref{b}, and
    \eqref{c}. If $s=0$ is Substituted into \eqref{a}, \eqref{b}, and
    \eqref{c} it is easily shown that $x=x_0$, $y=y_0$, and $z=z_0$.
    Therefore
    \begin{equation}\label{dwds}
        \bigg. \frac{dw}{ds}\bigg|_{s=0}=f_x(x_0,y_0,z_0)a+f_y(x_0,y_0,z_0)b+f_z(x_0,y_0,z_0)c
    \end{equation}
    The result \eqref{dwds} can berepresented as a dot product of two
    vectors,
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{dw}{ds}&=\begin{pmatrix}f_x(x_0, y_0, z_0)\\f_y(x_0, y_0, z_0)\\f_z(x_0, y_0, z_0)\end{pmatrix}\cdot\begin{pmatrix}a\\b\\c\end{pmatrix}\\
        &=\vec\nabla f(P)\cdot \vec u
    \end{align*}
    The above result is the directional derivative. The directional
    derivative of the function $f(x,y,z)$ at the point $P(x_0,y_0,z_0)$
    in the direction of the unit vector $\vec u$ is denoted and defined
    by
    \begin{align*}
        D_{\vec u}f(P)&=\bigg. \frac{dw}{ds}\bigg|_{s=0}\\
        D_{\vec u}f(P)&=\vec\nabla f(P)\cdot \vec u
    \end{align*}
    The directional derivative $D_{\vec u}f(P)$ is the rate of change of
    the function $f$ at the point $P$ in the direction of the unit
    vector $\vec u$.
    \subsubsection{Maximum and Minimum Rates}
    Recall the angle $\theta$ between the vectors $\vec a$ and $\vec b$
    is given by
    $$\cos\theta=\frac{\vec a\cdot \vec b}{||\vec a||\, ||\vec b||}$$
    Now let $\theta$ be the angle between $\vec\nabla f(P)$ and the unit
    vector $\vec u$
    $$\therefore \vec\nabla f(P)\cdot \vec u=||\vec\nabla f(P)||\,||\vec
    u||\cos\theta$$ but $\vec u$ is a unit vector and $||\vec u||=1$
    $$\vec\nabla f(P)\cdot \vec u=||\vec\nabla f(P)||\cos\theta$$
    $$\therefore D_{\vec u}f(P)= ||\vec\nabla f(P)||\cos\theta$$ The
    directional derivative has extreme values when $\cos\theta=\pm1$.
    $D_{\vec u}f(P)$ has an absolute maximum $||\vec\nabla f(P)||$ when
    $\theta=0$, and $\vec u$ must be in the direction of $\vec
    n_1=\frac{\vec\nabla f(P)}{||\vec\nabla f(P)||}$. $D_{\vec u}$ has
    an absolute minimum $-||\vec\nabla f(P)||$ when $\theta=\pi$ and
    must be in the direction of $\vec n_2=-\frac{\vec\nabla
    f(P)}{||\vec\nabla f(P)||}$.
    \subsection{Implicit Differentiation}
    \subsubsection{The Jacobian Determinant}
    The jacobian of 2 functions $F$ and $G$ with respect to the
    variables $x$ and $y$ is denoted and defined by
    $$J=\frac{\partial(F, G)}{\partial(x, y)}=\begin{vmatrix} F_x& F_y\\
        G_x& G_y \end{vmatrix}$$ Likewise the Jacobian of $n$ functions
    $f_1,\ f_2,\ f_3,\cdots f_n$ with respect to the n variables $x_1,\
    x_2,\cdots x_n$ is given by
    $$J=\frac{\partial(f_1, f_2,\cdots, f_n)}{\partial(x_1, x_2,\cdots,
        x_n)}=\begin{vmatrix} \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} &
        \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_2} & \cdots& \frac{\partial
        f_1}{\partial x_n}\\
        \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_1}&\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial
        x_2} & \cdots& \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x_n}\\
        \vdots& \vdots&\ddots & \vdots\\
        \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_1}& \frac{\partial f_n}{\partial
        x_2}& \cdots&\frac{\partial f_n}{\partial x_n} \\
    \end{vmatrix}$$ The Jacobian of one function $f$ with respect to the
    variable $x$ is simply $\frac{df}{dx}$
    \subsubsection{Implicit Differentiation}
    Consider a non-linear system that consists of $m$ equations in $n$
    variables, where $m\leq n$. Under certain conditions, we may be able
    to solve for $m$ variables as functions of the remaining $n-m$
    variables. For instance consider a system of one non-linear equation
    in three variables,
    $$F(x,y,z)=0$$ There are three possible ways to solve this system.
    It can be solved with $x$ as a function of $y$, and $z$; $y$ as a
    function of $x$, and $z$; or $z$ as a function of $x$ and $y$.
    Consider a system of two equations in 5 variables say 
    $$\left\{\begin{array}{lr} F(x,y,z,u,v)=0\\
        G(x,y,z,u,v)=0 \end{array}\right.$$ There are 10 possible
    choices of systems to solve for. If we wanted to find
    $\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}$ where $u=u(x,y,z)$ then it is
    denoted
    $$\left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}\right)_{x,y}$$ This denotes
    that $x$,$y$,$z$ are the independent variables and that $u$, and $v$
    depend on $x$, $y$, and $z$.
    \subsubsection{A formula for Implicit Integration:}
    Consider a non-linear system of two equations in four variables
    $$\left\{\begin{array}{lr} F(x,y,u,v)=0\\
        G(x,y,u,v)=0 \end{array}\right.$$ Assume that $u$ and $v$ depend
    on $x$, and $y$. The system has a condition of solvability and
    solutions $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$, $\frac{\partial
    u}{\partial y}$, $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$, and
    $\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}$. Let $w=F(x,y,u,v)=0$ where
    $u=u(x,y)$, $v=v(x,y)$ hence $w=w(x,y)$. By the chain rule
    $$\frac{\partial w}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial F}{\partial
    x}+\frac{\partial F}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial
    x}+\frac{\partial F}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$$ but
    with $w=0$ the following is obtained 
    \begin{equation}\label{Fpart}
        -\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial F}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial F}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
    \end{equation}
    similarly for $G$
    \begin{equation}\label{Gpart}
        -\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial G}{\partial u}\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial G}{\partial v}\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}
    \end{equation}
    The equation \eqref{Fpart} and \eqref{Gpart} are linear systems in
    $\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}$.
    By Cramer's rule
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\begin{vmatrix}
            -\frac{\partial F}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial v}\\
            -\frac{\partial G}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial G}{\partial v}
        \end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}
            \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial v}\\
            \frac{\partial G}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial G}{\partial v}
        \end{vmatrix}} &&
        \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=\frac{\begin{vmatrix}
            \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} & -\frac{\partial F}{\partial x}\\
            \frac{\partial G}{\partial u} & -\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}
        \end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}
            \frac{\partial F}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial F}{\partial v}\\
            \frac{\partial G}{\partial u} & \frac{\partial G}{\partial v}
        \end{vmatrix}}
    \end{align*}
    Using the Jacobian the following is obtained,
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=-\frac{\frac{\partial(F, G)}{\partial (x, v)}}{\frac{\partial(F, G)}{\partial (u, v)}} &&
        \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}=-\frac{\frac{\partial(F, G)}{\partial (u, x)}}{\frac{\partial(F, G)}{\partial (u, v)}}
    \end{align*}
    provided the denominator $\frac{\partial(F, G)}{\partial (u, v)}\neq
    0$. $\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}$ and $\frac{\partial v}{\partial
    y}$. If there is a non linear system
    $$F(x,y,z)=0$$ that can be solved for $y$ as a function of $x$ and
    $z$, then
    \begin{align*}
        \frac{\partial y}{\partial x}=-\frac{F_x}{F_y} && \frac{\partial y}{\partial z}=-\frac{F_z}{F_y}
    \end{align*}
    provided $F_y\neq 0$.

    \section{Double and Triple Integration}
    \subsection{Notation for a Double Integral}
    The double integral of a function $f(x,y)$ over a closed region $D$
    in the $xy$-plane (or $\mathbb{R}^2$) is denoted 
    $$\iint\limits_D f(x,y)\, dA$$ where $dA$ is an element of area and
    is given by
    $$dA=dx\, dy=dy\, dx$$
    \subsection{Notation for a Triple Integral}
    The triple integral of $f(x,y,z)$ over a closed region $E$ in
    $xyz$-space (or $\mathbb{R}^3$) is denoted by
    $$\iiint\limits_E f(x,y,z)\, dV$$ where $dV$ is an element of volume
    and is given by
    $$dV=dx\, dy\, dz$$
    \subsection{Types of regions in $\mathbb{R}^2$}
    \subsubsection{The $y$-simple Region:}
    A region $D$ is called a $y$-simple region if its bounded from the
    bottom and top by the continuous curves $y=g(x)$ and $y=h(x)$
    respectively and is bound from the left and right by the vertical
    lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ respectively as shown. A $y$-simple region may
    be sliced vertically and hence may be described by the pair of
    inequalities,
    $$D=\left\{\begin{array}{lr} a\leq x\leq b\\
        g(x)\leq y \leq h(x) \end{array}\right.$$
    \subsubsection{The $x$-simple Region:}
    A region $D$ is called a $x$-simple region if its bounded from the
    bottom and top by the horizontal lines $y=c$ and $y=d$ respectively
    and is bound from the left and right by the continuous curves
    $x=p(y)$ and $x=q(y)$ respectively as shown. A $x$-simple region may
    be sliced vertically and hence may be described by the pair of
    inequalities,
    $$D=\left\{\begin{array}{lr} p(y)\leq x\leq q(y)\\
        c\leq y \leq d \end{array}\right.$$
    \begin{figure}[th!]
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{x-simple.eps}
        \hspace{0.09\textwidth}
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{y-simple.eps}
        \caption{An $x$ (left) and $y$-simple (right) region}
    \end{figure}\\\\
    Some regions in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are both $x$ and $y$-simple. However
    some regions in $\mathbb{R}^2$ are neither $x$ OR $Y$-simple. In
    such a case the region may be subdivided into $m$ non-overlapping
    regions each of which is $x$-simple, $y$-simple, or both. Let $D$ be
    a planar region. Assume $D$ is subdivided into $m$ non-overlapping
    regions where
    $$D=D_1\cup D_2\cup\cdots\cup D_m$$ then if $f(x,y)$ is a function
    on $D$ then 
    $$\iint\limits_Df(x,y)\, dA=\iint\limits_{D_1}f(x,y)\,
    dA+\iint\limits_{D_2}f(x,y)\, dA+\cdots+\iint\limits_{D_m}f(x,y)\,
    dA$$  
    \subsection{Types of regions in $\mathbb{R}^3$}
    The description of a $z$-simple region in $\mathbb{R}^3$ is given.
    The description for $x$ and $y$-simple regions is similar. A region
    in three space is called $z$ simple if it is bounded from the bottom
    and top by the continuous surfaces $z=g(x,y)$ and $z=h(x,y)$
    respectively. A $z$-simple region may be sliced vertically and hence
    is described by 
    $$E=\left\{\begin{array}{lr} g(x,y)\leq z\leq h(x,y)\\
        (x,y)\in B \end{array}\right.$$ Where $B$ is a region in
    $\mathbb{R}^2$.
    \subsection{A definite partial integral}
    A definite integral of the form 
    $$\int\limits_{x=g(y)}^{x=h(x)}f(x,y)\, \partial x\ \ \mathrm{ or }\
    \ \int\limits_{g(y)}^{h(y)}f(x,y)\, dx$$ is a definite partial
    integral with respect to $x$. To compute the definite partial
    integral, integrate $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ but treating $y$ as
    constant. Definite partial integrals of three or more variables are
    defined similarly.
    \subsection{An Iterated Integral}
    An iterated integral consists of two or more definite partial
    integrals. For instance
    $$\int\limits_c^d\int\limits_a^b f(x,y)\, dx\, dy$$ is an example of
    an iterated integral. To compute an iterated integral and evaluate
    outward.
    \subsection{Setting Up Limits for a Double Integral:}
    Given the double integral
    $$\iint\limits_D f(x,y)\, dA$$ If region $D$ is a $y$-simple region.
    For a $y$-simple region, the region is sliced vertically, and hence
    to integrate over a $y$-simple region $dA$ is written,
    $$dA=dy\, dx$$ It follows that the integral becomes
    $$\int\limits_a^b\int\limits_{g(x)}^{h(x)}f(x,y)\, dy\, dx$$

    If region $D$ is a $x$-simple region, the region is sliced
    horizontally, and hence to integrate over a $x$-simple region $dA$
    is written,
    $$dA=dx\, dy$$ It follows that the integral becomes
    $$\int\limits_c^d\int\limits_{p(x)}^{q(x)}f(x,y)\, dx\, dy$$
    \subsection{Setting up Limits for a Triple Integral}
    Consider the triple integral
    $$\iiint \limits_E f(x,y,z)\, dV$$ Here assume that the region $E$
    is $z$-simple. Setting up the limits for and $x$-simple or
    $y$-simple region is similar. Recall for $z$-simple regions they are
    sliced vertically and hence integrate with respect to $z$ first.
    That is
    $$dV=dz\, dA$$ Once the inner most integral is computed, the triple
    integral is reduced to a double integral.
    \subsection{Geometric Interpretation of the Double Integral:}
    Consider the double integral
    $$\iint\limits_D f(x,y)\, dA$$ for simplicity sake, we shall assume
    $f(x,y)\geq 0$ for $(x,y)\in D$. Let $S$ be the surface given by the
    equation $z=f(x,y)$, and let $V$ be the volume which lies vertically
    bellow $S$ and above the $xy$ plane on the region $D$. The slice
    $dA=dx\, dy$ is a small area on $D$. Therefore it is implied that
    $$V=\iint\limits_Df(x,y)\, dA$$ In general where $f(x,y)$ is not
    necessarily greater than or equal to zero. In general the triple
    integral, 
    $$\iiint\limits_Ef(x,y,z)\, dV$$ is the signed hyper volume in four
    dimensional space. If $f(x,y)=1$ on $D$ then the integral reduces to
    $$A=\iint\limits_D dA$$ and gives the area of $D$. If $f(x,y,z)=1$
    in the region $E$ then the integral reduces to
    $$V=\iiint\limits_EdV$$ and gives the volume of the region $E$. This
    implies that a volume can be computed by either a double or triple
    integral.
    \subsection{Polar, Cylindrical and Spherical Coordinate Systems:}
    \subsubsection{Polar Coordinates System:}
    \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.5\textwidth}
        \vspace{-20pt}
        \includegraphics[width=0.45\textwidth]{polarCord.eps}
        \vspace{-100pt}
    \end{wrapfigure}
    Let $P(x,y )$ be a point in the $xy$-plane. The polar coordinates of
    $P$ are $r$, and $\theta$ where $r$ is the distance between the
    origin and the point $P$ and $r\in[0, \infty)$ and $\theta$ is the
    angle between $\vec{OP}$ and the positive $x$-axis and $\theta\in[0,
    2\pi]$. The cartesian and polar coordinates are usually displayed on
    the same figure as shown and have the following relationships,
    \begin{align*}
        x=r\cos\theta\\
        y=r\sin\theta\\
        r^2=x^2+y^2\\
        \frac{y}{x}=\tan\theta\\
        dA=r\, dr\, d\theta
    \end{align*} 
    \subsubsection{Cylindrical Coordinate System:}
    The cylindrical coordinate system is a three dimensional version of
    polar coordinates. The point $P(x,y,z)$ is $(r, \theta, z)$ in
    cylindrical coordinates.
    \subsubsection{Spherical Coordinate System} 
    The spherical coordinate system is closely related to the
    geographical longitudes and latitudes. Let $P(x,y,z)$ be a point of
    the surface of a sphere. The spherical coordinates of $P$ are
    $\rho$, $\phi$, and $\theta$ where where $\rho$ is the distance from
    the origin to $P$ with $\rho\in[0,\infty)$, $\phi$ is the angle made
    between $\vec {OP}$ and the positive $z$-axis with $\phi\in[0, \pi]$
    and $\theta$ is the angle made between $\vec{OQ}$ and th positive
    $x$-axis with $\theta\in[0,2\pi]$.
    \begin{align}
        x&=r\cos\theta\label{rx}\\
        y&=r\sin\theta\label{ry}\\
        r^2&=x^2+y^2\label{r2}\\
        r&=\rho\sin\phi\label{rrho}\\
        z&=\rho\cos\phi\label{zrho}\\
        \rho^2&=z^2+r^2\label{rho2}
    \end{align}
    Substitute \eqref{rrho} into \eqref{rx}, \eqref{ry}, \eqref{r2}, and
    \eqref{rho2}, to obtain,
    \begin{align*}
        x&=\rho\,\sin\phi\,\cos\theta\\
        y&=\rho\,\sin\phi\,\sin\theta\\
        z&=\rho\cos\phi\\
        \rho^2&=x^2+y^2+z^2\\
        x^2+y^2&=\rho^2\sin^2\phi\\
        dV&=\rho^2\sin\phi\,d\rho\, d\phi\, d\theta
    \end{align*}
    When the equations describing a region $D$ contain $x^2+y^2$,
    substitute $x^2+y^2=r^2$ and use polar or cylindrical coordinates.
    When the equation describing a region $E$ contains $x^2+y^2+z^2$,
    substitute $x^2+y^2+z^2=\rho^2$, and use spherical coordinates.
    \subsubsection{A special Curve in Polar Coordinates:}
    The equation of a circle centered at $(0,0)$ and with radius $a$ is
    given by 
    $$x^2+y^2=a^2$$ in polar coordinates $r^2=x^2+y^2$ so therefore
    $r^2=a^2$, or
    $$r=a$$
    \subsubsection{A special Surface in cylindrical Coordinates}
    Recall that a cylinder can be given by any curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$
    projected into $\mathbb{R}^3$. Therefore the right circular cylinder
    is given by the equation of a circle. From above it can be seen that
    a circular cylinder in cylindrical coordinates, centered at $(0,0)$,
    and with radius $a$ can be given by,
    $$r=a$$
    \subsubsection{Three Special Surfaces in Spherical Coordinates:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The equation of a sphere of radius $a$ centered at
        $(0,0,0)$ is given by 
        $$x^2+y^2+z^2=a^2$$ in spherical coordinates
        $x^2+y^2+z^2=\rho^2$
        $$\therefore \rho=a$$
        \item The equation of a sphere of radius $a$ with center
        $(0,0,a)$ is given by 
        \begin{align*}
            x^2+y^2+(z-a)^2&=a^2\\
            x^2+y^2+z^2&=2az
        \end{align*}
        In spherical coordinates $z=\rho\cos\phi$ and
        $x^2+y^2+z^2=\rho^2$, 
        \begin{align*}
            \therefore\rho^2&=2a\rho\cos\phi\\
            \rho=2a\cos\phi
        \end{align*}
        \item The equation of a cone is given by
        $$z=\alpha \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$$ in spherical coordinates
        $z=\rho\cos\phi$ and $x^2+y^2=\rho^2\sin^2\phi$, so
        \begin{align*}
            \rho\cos\phi&=\alpha\sqrt{\rho^2\sin^2\phi}\\
            \therefore \phi&=\tan^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)
        \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsubsection{Setting Up Limits of Integration in Polar Coordinates:}
    Given the double integral
    $$\iint\limits_Df(x,y)\,dA$$ To compute using polar coordinates,
    apply the following three steps,
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In the expression of $f(x,y)$, replace $x$ by
        $r\cos\theta$, $y$ by $r\sin\theta$, and $x^2+y^2$ by $r^2$.
        \item Replace $dA$ by $r\, dr\, d\theta$
        \item Express $D$ in polar coordinates.
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Application of Double and Triple Integrals in Calculating Mass, Moments, Centers of Mass, and Centroids}
    Let $D$ be the planar region occupied by a thin plate or lamina.
    Assume that the plate is not uniform and that the area density is
    given by the function
    $$\delta(x,y)$$ The mass is given by definition as the sum of the
    elements of mass
    $$dm=\delta(x,y)\, dA$$ The mass is given by 
    $$m=\iint\limits_D\delta(x,y)\, dA$$ The moment about the $y$ axis
    may be denoted $M_{x=0}$. By definition the element of moment about
    the $y$-axis is
    $$dM_{x=0}=x\, dm$$ The total moment is then given by,
    $$M_{x=0}=\iint\limits_D x\, dm$$ likewise the moment about the
    $x$-axis is 
    $$M_{y=0}=\iint\limits_D y\, dm$$ The center of mass $(\bar x, \bar
    y)$ is an imaginary point where the entire mass is assumed to be
    concentrated. By definition
    \begin{align*}
        M_{x=0}=\bar x m&\Rightarrow\bar x=\frac{M_{x=0}}{m}\\
        M_{y=0}=\bar y m&\Rightarrow\bar y=\frac{M_{y=0}}{m}
    \end{align*} 
    If the lamina is uniform then its density is
    constant\footnotemark[2]
    $$\delta(x,y)=C$$ In such a case, the center is mass is referred to
    as a centroid. Likewise let $E$ be the region in three space
    occupied by a solid. Assume the solid is not uniform and that the
    density function is
    $$\delta(x,y,z)$$ The mass is given by
    $$m=\iiint\limits_E dm$$ The moment about the $yz$-plane is
    $$M_{x=0}=\iiint\limits_E x\, dm$$ The moment about the $xz$-plane
    is
    $$M_{y=0}=\iiint\limits_E y\, dm$$ The moment about the $xy$-plane
    is
    $$M_{z=0}=\iiint\limits_E z\, dm$$ The center of mass $(\bar x, \bar
    y, \bar z)$ is given by
    \begin{align*}
        \bar x=\frac{M_{x=0}}{m}&&\bar y=\frac{M_{y=0}}{m}&&\bar z=\frac{M_{z=0}}{m}
    \end{align*}
    if $\delta(x,y,z)$ is constant\footnotemark[2] then the center of
    mass is the centroid. In all equations above $dm=\delta(x,y,z)\,
    dV$.

    \section{Extreme Values for functions of Several Variables}
    \subsection{Critical Points}
    Let $f(x,y)$ be a function of the two independent variables $x$, and
    $y$. The critical points of $f(x,y)$ occur where
    $$\vec\nabla f(x,y)=\begin{pmatrix} 0\\0 \end{pmatrix}$$ Therefore
        the critical points occur at the solutions to the non-linear
        system of equations,
    $$\left\{\begin{array}{lr} f_x=0\\
        f_y=0 \end{array}\right.$$
    \subsection{The Hessian Matrix and the Second Derivative Test}
    \subsubsection{Quadric Forms of a matrix}
    Let $\vec x$ be a $n\times1$ vector and $A$ be a $n\times n$
    symmetric matrix. Consider the expression
    $$\vec x \cdot A \vec x$$ $A$ is referred to as positive definite if
    $\vec x \cdot A \vec x>0$ for all non-zero vectors $\vec x$. $A$ is
    referred to as negative definite if $\vec x \cdot A \vec x<0$ for
    all non-zero vectors $\vec x$. $A$ is referred to as positive semi
    definite if $\vec x \cdot A \vec x\geq0$ for all non-zero vectors
    $\vec x$. $A$ is referred to as negative semi definite if $\vec x
    \cdot A \vec x\leq0$ for all non-zero vectors $\vec x$. If there are
    vectors $\vec x$, and $\vec y$ such that $\vec x \cdot A \vec x>0$
    and $\vec y \cdot A \vec y<0$ then $A$ is indefinite.\\
    Alternatively let $D_i$ be the determinant of the upper left
    $i\times i$ block of $A$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $D_i>0$ for all $i$ then $A$ is positive definite.
        \item If $D_i>0$ for all even values of $i$ and $D_i<0$ for all
        odd values of $i$ then $A$ is negative definite.
        \item If $D_n=|A|\neq0$ and neither 1 nor 2 hold then $A$ is
        indefinite.
        \item If $|A|=0$ then $A$ could be positive or negative semi
        definite or indefinite but not positive nor negative definite.
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsubsection{The Hessian Matrix}
    Let $f(x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_n)$ be a function such that all second
    order partials are continuous. The Hessian matrix of $f$ is denoted
    and defined by
    $$H=\begin{pmatrix} f_{x_1x_1} & f_{x_1x_2}& \cdots &f_{x_1x_n}\\
        f_{x_2x_1}& f_{x_2x_2}&\cdots&f_{x_2x_n}\\
        \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
        f_{x_nx_1}&f_{x_nx_2}&\cdots&f_{x_nx_n}\\
    \end{pmatrix}$$ Note that as the second order partials are
    continuous $H$ is a symmetric matrix.
    \subsubsection{The second Derivative Test}
    Suppose $(a,b)$ is a critical point for $f:\vec\nabla f(a,b)=0$
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $H(a,b)$ is positive definite, then $f$ has a local min
        at $(a,b)$
        \item If $H(a,b)$ is negative definite, then $f$ has a local max
        at $(a,b)$
        \item If $H(a,b)$ is indefinite, then $f$ has a saddle point at
        $(a,b)$
        \item If $H(a,b)$ is positive or negative semi definite then the
        test is inconclusive.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \subsection{The Discriminant and Second Derivative Test for a function of Several Variables}
    \subsubsection{The Discriminant}
    Let $f(x,y)$ be a function of two independent variables. The second
    order partials of $f$ are $f_{xx}$, $f_{xy}$, $f_{yy}$, and
    $f_{yx}$. Let the discriminant of $f$ be denoted and defined by
    $$D(x,y)=(f_{xy})^2-f_{xx}f_{yy}$$
    \subsubsection{The second derivative test}
    Let $f(x,y)$ be a function of the two independent variables $x$, and
    $y$, and let $P(x_0, y_0)$ be a critical point for the function $f$.
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $D(x_0, y_0)<0$ and $f_{xx}>0$, $f$ has a local minimum
        at $P$.
        \item If $D(x_0, y_0)<0$ and $f_{xx}<0$, $f$ has a local maximum
        at $P$.
        \item If $D(x_0, y_0)>0$, $f$ has a neither a local minimum or
        maximum at $P$. Such a point is referred to as a saddle point
        and occurs when $f$ is at a local minimum in $x$ and a local
        maximum in $y$ or vice versa.
        \item If $D(x_0, y_0)=0$ the test is inconclusive.

    \subsection{Extreme Values for functions of several variables}
    Let $f(x,y)$ be a function of two independent variables and let $D$
    be a closed region in the $xy$-plane. To find the extreme values of
    $f$ over the region $D$, first calculate all critical points in the
    interior of the region $D$. Next find all critical points on the
    boundary of the region $D$, and compute $f$ at these critical points
    as well as at endpoints of the region. Finally compare all the
    obtained values if $f$. The largest value of $f$ computed is the
    absolute maximum of $f$ on $D$. Likewise the smallest computed value
    of $f$ is the absolute maximum of $f$ on $D$.
    \subsection{Method of Lagrange Multipliers}
    Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is bound by the constraint $g(x,y)=C$. Then
    the maximum and minimum points of $f$ on $g$ are solutions to the
    following non-linear system of equations,
    $$\left\{\begin{array}{lr} \vec\nabla f=\lambda \vec\nabla g\\
        g(x,y)=C \end{array}\right.$$ where $\lambda$ is a constant
    referred to as a Lagrange Multiplier.
